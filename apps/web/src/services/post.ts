    body: `<i>In his animated short film titled It’s Such a Beautiful Day (2012), Don Hertzfeldt delivers an introspective story about a man suffering from mental illness and conveys a common message with beauty.</i><br/><br/><i>It’s Such a Beautiful Day</i> opens with a low-angle shot of a tree. Its leaves rustle with the breeze while clouds glaze the clear sky. For a shot that would’ve been visually appealing, however, it’s captured in black-and-white and at a low framerate. Barring color, we’re not treated to white, full clouds, a bright blue sky, healthy green leaves, or a friendly breeze. The choppy nature of low framerate footage makes the rustling of the tree appear aggressive as if being attacked by the wind.<br/><br/>The opening scene is lifeless. Yet, it’s fascinating that few analyze it as a gateway to the story of Bill, a man suffering from mental illness and confronted by death. To him, the world is exactly that: black-and-white, choppy, and lifeless. He’s surrounded by constant paranoia and loneliness. He has few friends and family. Every day, he wakes up and repeats the day before, contemplating his repetitive life.<br/><br/>It’s clear Bill is undergoing an existential crisis. However, we’re first introduced to his psychological illnesses as he visits his doctor. It’s uncertain what his diagnosis is, but we experience his symptoms of dementia, schizophrenia, delusion, and hallucination. It’s moments like these that are terrifying. Hertzfeldt emulates such symptoms through entropic flurries of disturbing sounds, voices, and imagery. Loosely related, incompatible sounds and pictures are amalgamated in an unsettling way.<br/><br/>One day, he inexplicably passes out. In the following scene, we start to gauge Hertzfeldt’s true message of his film. This scene is a moment of superlative writing and storytelling, thoroughly showcasing Bill’s true thoughts and fears.<br/><br/><br/><div style="font-weight:300; font-style:italic; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">He’d been terrified of dying his entire life… this stupid, awkward moment of death that had invaded and distracted so many days with stress and wasted time.</div><br/><br/>It’s when his doctor says “you don’t have very long to live” when he finally starts to live. He repeats the same things he did the day before, but, this time, the world is no longer black-and-white. Everything’s colorful and lively, and he’s learned to appreciate the little things of life. From the sun shining to the smell of the air to the grain patterns in his cabinets to the way a paper towel consumes water, everything fascinates him. As he gazes into the night sky, he finds himself in awe and asks:<br/><br/><br/><div style="font-weight:300; font-style:italic; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">Isn’t everything amazing?</div><br/><br/>Confronting death, he’s found purpose. He sings. He laughs. He cries. He explores. Perhaps the most heart-wrenching scene is when he drives to see his father, who had abandoned him, for the last time. They stand together awkwardly in silence underneath the colorful trees, until Bill says:<br/><br/><br/><div style="font-weight:300; font-style:italic; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">You are forgiven.</div><br/><br/>Bill goes on to be immortal, having countless numbers of wives and children as he lives numerous lifetimes. Bill explores everything there is to explore, learns everything there is to learn, and teaches everything there is to teach. Eventually, the Earth dies with the expansion of the Sun, and Bill is left adrift in space. Finally, each star disappears, one by one, until he is the last entity remaining in the void.<br/><br/>Despite spanning only an hour, this film packs quite a punch. Hertzfeldt takes us down the life story of a man, one who is broken by his psychological volatility. In doing so, he conveys important life lessons that anyone can learn from. It’s simple. Live to forgive and forget. Live every day like it's your last. The film gives the impression of being simple, yet, at the same time, it’s ultimately profound. This film is every bit as horrifying, mesmerizing, and timeless. Hertzfeldt takes a fictitious, animated stick figure and tells his story in a way that we’ll never forget.<br/><br/>Not everyone can relate to Bill. But everyone can relate to his story.`,
